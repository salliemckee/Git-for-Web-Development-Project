# Setting Up Your Computer

Welcome to day 1 at BloomTech, today we are going to spend time setting up your computer and learning the tools that you will be using to complete this program. Just like day 1 at a job, you will need to get your environment set up to build and run your code. Complete the set up tasks below and then get started on the research questions. Once you have finished check out the submission instructions in the `README.md` file to turn in your assignment for the day. 

## Set Up Tasks 
1. [x] [Download xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) - these are your developer tools for mac 
2. [x] sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) - please use a professional username. We recommending using your `firstname` `lastname`
3. [x] [Set up your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) - GitHub uses SSH to keep their files secure. You will need to set up one SSH key for every computer that you want to access your GitHub account on. Please ensure you go through all of the steps to generate a new key, add a new key and test your connection.
4. [x] [Download Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) - make sure your zoom display name is your `first name` `last name`
5. [x] [Download Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/207677868-Download-Slack-for-Mac) - make sure your slack display name is your `first name` `last name` 
6. [x] [Download VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - this will be the tool you use to write all of your code. We recommend installing the following extensions: 
- [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
7. [x] [Download Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Please download the latest stable version. We will be using Node.JS to run the tests in all of our javaScript assignments. Test driven development is a common practice in the world of web dev. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/) 
8. [x] Sign up for a free [codepen account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free)
9. [x] Sign up for a free account on [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign[â€¦]tTwOoXp_lCeLTC97pikTFa5cE58FWHwjjpTSGsGPRqR2AAaAh-MEALw_wcB)

## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You can type your answer below the questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) doc short for documentation are the instructions on how to use a languge, or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your google skills. 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and GitHub? 
Git is an open source distributed version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. It has a remote version stored on a central server and a local version stored on the developer's computer. GitHub is an exclusively cloud-based for-profit hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
2. Why do we create a branch? 
Branching isolates your work from other team members, allowing you to work on features or bug fixes without making permanent changes to the repository. 
3. What is the purpose of a pull request? 
Pull requests let others know about the changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. You can also discuss and review changes with collaborators before changes are merged into the base branch.
4. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on a feature branch and you want to switch back to main. 
git checkout
5. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull` what does each command do? 
git fetch fetches a specific branch from the repository. git pull fetches the specific remote's copy of a current branch and immediately merges it to the local copy. git push pushes the branch to remote along with the necessary commits and objects.
6. What is a merge conflict? How do you resolve a merge conflict? 
Merge conflicts are when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. You have to resolve merge conflicts with a new commit using the command line and text editor before you can merge branches.
